# ðŸ§  Sign Language Detection ðŸ¤Ÿ

A real-time Sign Language Detection system that uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize hand gestures and translate them into readable text or speech. This project aims to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the general public.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time video feed for gesture detection
- Hand gesture recognition using deep learning (CNN)
- Live text translation of detected signs
- Optional speech synthesis for vocal output
- Supports American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet (can be extended)

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: OpenCV (for video capture and display), Tkinter/Streamlit/React (optional UI)
- **Backend**: Python
- **ML/DL**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network trained on ASL dataset
- **Others**: Mediapipe (for hand tracking), pyttsx3/gTTS (for text-to-speech)
